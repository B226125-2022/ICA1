# Step by step of what I did
# The paired-end RNAseq sequence data are provided in the directory
# get paired-end RNAseq sequence data:

cp -r /localdisk/home/data/BPSM/ICA1/fastq ~/ICA1

#recursive or -r means just copy the contents inside the directory as well. 

#fastqc files
fastqc *.fastq.gz -o ~/ICA1/fastq_files

#import/cp Tcongo genome
cp -r /localdisk/data/BPSM/ICA1/Tcongo_genome ~/ICA1
